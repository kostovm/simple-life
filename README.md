# Simple Life

A **multi-page collection** of simple but useful JavaScript applications, rewritten in **TypeScript** and adapted for the web. These apps were originally **console-based exercises** from SoftUni’s JavaScript courses, but I transformed them into **interactive web applications** to improve my **DOM manipulation, event handling, and TypeScript skills**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript & TypeScript** – No frameworks or libraries, just raw JS/TS.
- **Interactive UI** – Originally designed for console execution, now adapted for the web.
- **Scalable & Modular Structure** – As the project grows, improvements like **shared CSS** and **utility functions** are introduced to keep the structure clean and efficient.
- **Live Demo Available** – Try it out: [ttrtt.site](https://ttrtt.site)

## 🎯 Why This Project?
Instead of relying on frameworks, this project reinforces **core JavaScript and TypeScript** skills. Understanding vanilla JS deeply makes learning frameworks like **Angular** much easier in the long run.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kostovm/simple-life.git
   ```
2. **Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript**  
   ```sh
   tsc
   ```
3. **Run the App**  
   Open `index.html` in a **Live Server**.  

On the main page, you can **select different applications** to load and use.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- **More Applications** – Constantly expanding the collection.
